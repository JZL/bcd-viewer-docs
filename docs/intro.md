# Getting Started

Welcome to BrainCellData! This site is managed by the [Macosko
lab](https://macoskolab.com) at the [Broad
Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org). This site is currently home to two
large datasets. The first is an atlas of transcriptionally defined cell types
of the mouse brain generated by the clustering of single-nucleus RNA-seq across
100 brain regions. The second is a Slide-seq spatial transcriptomics atlas of
one mouse brain hemispehere, generated together with [Fei
Chenâ€™s](https://www.insitubiology.org) lab.

For downloading the data, go to the [Downloads](../downloads) tab.

For exploring the data in the viewer, go to the <a
href="https://www.braincelldata.org" target="_self">`Viewer`</a> application.

Information about the viewer components, functionality, and architecture can be
found in the following pages (navigate using navigation bar or use the links
that appear below on this page).

## Viewer Overview

The Brain Cell Data viewer is a web application that allows users to view and
explore brain cell data. It is composed of three, interlinked tabs. *GeneExp*
allows users to plot the expression of one or two genes in the Slide-seq atlas.
*SingleCell* allows users to plot gene expression in the snRNA-seq atlas.
*CellSpatial* shows the spatial localization of the snRNA-seq cell types in the
Slide-seq dataset.

For detailed information about each tab of the viewer, see the respective
viewer subsections in the documentation.
