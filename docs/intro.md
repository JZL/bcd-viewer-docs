For using the viewer, go to the [`Viewer`](https://www.braincelldata.org) application.

Information about the viewer components, functionality, and architecture can be
found in the following pages.

## Viewer Overview

The Brain Cell Data viewer is a web application that allows users to view and
explore brain cell data. It is composed of the following three, interlinked
tabs: GeneExpr, SingleCell, and CellSpatial. The GeneExp tabl allows the user
to select puck and genes to view the spacial expression of the genes at sampled
locations across the puck. 

The selection of pucks, genes, and
cells is synchoronized across all three tabs. The GeneExp tab displays gene
expression data for all sampled beads in the selected puck. The SingleCell tab
shows celltypes expressing a selected gene in a dotplot format along with
various filtering options to search for celltypes of interest. The CellSpatial
tab displays spatial data for the selected cell.
