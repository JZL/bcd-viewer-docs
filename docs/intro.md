# Getting Started

Welcome to BrainCellData!  This site is home to single cell and spatial
genomics datasets generated by the [Macosko lab](https://macoskolab.com/) at
the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org). This site is home to two large datasets.  The first is an
atlas of transcriptionally defined cell types of the mouse brain generated by
the clustering of single-nucleus RNA-seq across 100 brain regions.  The second
is a spatial transcriptomics atlas of one mouse brain hemispehere, generated by
Slide-seq, which was generated in close collaboration with [Fei Chenâ€™s lab](https://www.insitubiology.org/).

<!--Welcome to the documentation of Brain Cell Data Viewer! Here you can download
the data used in viewer and also find information about the various functional
and architectural information about the viewer.

For downloading the data, go to the [`Downloads`](../downloads) tab.

For exploring the data in the viewer, go to the <a href="https://www.braincelldata.org"
target="_self">`Viewer`</a> application.

Information about the viewer components, functionality, and architecture can be
found in the following pages (navigate using side bar or use the link to <i>next</i>
page at the bottom of this page).

## Viewer Overview

The Brain Cell Data viewer is a web application that allows users to view and
explore brain cell data. It is composed of the following three, interlinked
tabs: GeneExpr, SingleCell, and CellSpatial. The GeneExp tabl allows the user
to select puck and genes to view the spacial expression of the genes at sampled
locations across the puck. 

The selection of pucks, genes, and
cells is synchoronized across all three tabs. The GeneExp tab displays gene
expression data for all sampled beads in the selected puck. The SingleCell tab
shows celltypes expressing a selected gene in a dotplot format along with
various filtering options to search for celltypes of interest. The CellSpatial
tab displays spatial data for the selected cell.
